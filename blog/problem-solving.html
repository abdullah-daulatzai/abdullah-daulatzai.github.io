                <strong class="p-relative"> Problems I faced</strong> <br/></br>
                During the JavaScript Kata Challenge, I encountered several obstacles, especially with built-in methods. To tackle this, I took some time to explore different methods in greater detail. I found the Rubber Duck technique particularly helpful: I explained to my artificial flower why a specific method was necessary and how it could solve my Kata problem. This practice significantly improved my understanding of the method’s functionality, making it easier to resolve the challenges.

            </br>
          </br>
          <p> For the FlipFlop challenge, I employed the pseudocode technique, which proved invaluable. It allowed me to outline exactly what to include in my code and the steps to follow. Additionally, I relied heavily on <span style="color: rgba(255, 132, 0, 0.849);">console.log</span>, using it about 80% of the time whenever I faced a challenge or needed to verify the output of my code.
      </p>
    </br>
  <p>When it came to accessing elements in an array of arrays, I turned to Google for guidance. I also encountered an issue with capitalizing the first letter of each string. Initially, I tried using a loop and an iterator, but I realized it was accessing the first letter of the first string, then the second letter of the second string, rather than just the first letter of each string. After some research, I discovered that the <span style="color: rgb(225, 255, 0);">slice()</span> method would be particularly useful. Once I modified my code to use this method, it effectively resolved the issue.</p>
  
  <p>Overall, the process was challenging and at times a bit exhausting. However, successfully overcoming each challenge brought me a sense of reward and happiness.</p>

      <strong class="p-relative"> Reflecting on my confidence with problem-solving technique</strong>: <br/></br>
     <ol>
      <li>Pseudocode: I feel quite confident using pseudocode. It helps me organize my thoughts and clarify my approach before jumping into coding. Having a structured plan makes the actual implementation feel much easier.</li>
      <li>Trying Something: I’m becoming more comfortable with just diving in and experimenting. While it can be intimidating, I’ve learned that trial and error often leads to valuable insights, and I appreciate the learning that comes from it.</li>
      <li>Rubber Ducky Method: This method has really boosted my confidence. Explaining my thought process out loud helps me catch mistakes and solidify my understanding. It feels less silly each time I do it!</li>
      <li>Reading Error Messages: I’m improving here, but I still have moments of uncertainty. I try to take the time to really understand what the error messages mean, and with practice, I'm getting better at troubleshooting based on them.</li>
     <li>Console.logging: I feel very confident using console.log. It’s become my go-to debugging tool. I use it regularly to check outputs and track how my code is executing, and it really helps me diagnose issues.</li>
     <li>Googling: I’m quite confident with this technique. I’ve learned to effectively search for solutions and find resources that help clarify concepts or provide examples. It’s an essential skill that I rely on often.</li>
