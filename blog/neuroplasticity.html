                Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt. It means that our brain can create new connections and adjust itself based on what we learn, experience, or practice. So, when we try new things or keep learning, your brain can grow and improve.
              </p>
              <p>Neuroplasticity is essential for learning and memory, as well as recovery from brain injuries or diseases.

    A growth mindset is the belief that you can improve your abilities and intelligence through effort, practice, and learning. It means you think challenges are opportunities to grow and that you can get better at things over time with persistence.

  <strong class="p-relative"> How Neuroplasticity and a Growth Mindset Influence My Learning? </strong> <br/></br>
  Neuroplasticity and a growth mindset both play a big role in my studies. Neuroplasticity helps me understand that my brain can adapt and improve with practice, so I keep pushing myself to learn and try new things. Having a growth mindset means I see challenges as chances to grow, not as obstacles. This mindset keeps me motivated and focused on learning, even when things get tough. I also repeatedly practice anything that feels hard or that I need to remember for a long time. Together, these approaches help me stay positive and make the most of my study time.
