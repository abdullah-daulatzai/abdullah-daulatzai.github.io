              My Wellbeing Plan Using Te Whare Tapa Whā
            </h2>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                I like to use Tā Mason Durie’s Te Whare Tapa Whā model to think about my wellbeing. It helps me focus on different parts of my health. Here’s my plan:
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                <strong class="p-relative"> 1. Taha Tinana (Physical)</strong>: <br/></br>
                For my physical health, I want to exercise for at least one hour every day. I enjoy running and walking, so I’ll make sure to include those. Eating healthy is important too, so I’ll focus on eating more fruits, veggies, and whole grains. I’ll also go for regular health check-ups.
              </p>
            </br>
            <p>
              <strong class="p-relative"> 2. Taha Hinengaro (Mental)</strong>: <br/></br>
              Taking care of my mental health is a priority. I plan to practice mindfulness or meditation for about 10 minutes each day. Writing in a journal helps me sort out my thoughts, so I’ll keep doing that. I also want to limit my screen time and spend more time reading or doing puzzles.
         </p>
            </br>
          
        <p>
          <strong class="p-relative"> 3. Taha Whānau (Family)</strong>: <br/></br>
          Staying connected with my family is important. I’ll plan weekly family gatherings or game nights. I’ll make sure to check in with them regularly, even just with a quick text. Supporting each other in our goals and celebrating wins together will help us stay close.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <strong class="p-relative"> 4. Taha Wairua (Spiritual)</strong>: <br/></br>
          For my spiritual health, I want to spend more time in nature. It helps me reflect and recharge. I’ll also look for ways to volunteer in my community and explore practices that feel meaningful to me, like meditation or cultural activities.
        </p>
