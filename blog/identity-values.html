                My name is Abdullah Daulatzai. I am from Afghanistan, was born and raised in Pakistan, completed my bachelor’s degree in Sri Lanka, and moved to New Zealand in August 2023. One of the toughest times for me was dealing with racism and wrong ideas about my Afghan heritage. When people had misunderstandings about my culture, I decided not to get upset. Instead, I chose to talk to them and explain who we are. Even though it was uncomfortable, I thought it was important to show respect and understanding. This way, I was able to change some people's views and help them see things differently.

          <p> I’ve learned how important it is to show respect, be kind, and treat everyone fairly, no matter where they come from. These lessons help me to accept diversity and approach people with an open mind and heart.
            I  choose dev Academy  , because I see it as a chance to get mentorship, improve my skills, and build the confidence I need to succeed in IT and find a job in the industry.  My strengths—kindness, resilience, empathy, adaptability
