                <strong class="p-relative">  Long-Term Career Goal</strong>: <br/></br>
                My long-term career goal is to establish my own tech startup. To achieve this, my five-year plan involves working at a tech company to refine my skills, connect with like-minded professionals, build a robust network, and gain insights into local tech markets and audiences. My interests lie in roles such as full stack developer, software engineer, or DevOps.
              </p>
            </br>
          </br>
          <p> I am good at learning quickly when there are clear instructions, but I sometimes get bored and distracted easily, which makes managing my time challenging. I know I need to work on my time management, problem-solving skills, and emotional intelligence, and I hope to develop these areas while at Dev Academy.oose dev Academy  , because I see it as a chance to get mentorship, improve my skills, and build the confidence I need to succeed in IT and find a job in the industry.  My strengths—kindness, resilience, empathy, adaptability
      </p>
    </br>
    <p> To manage my workload, I’ve decided to leave my previous job so I can focus completely on this bootcamp. I’ll be dedicated to completing as many practical projects as I can and learning as much as possible during these 17 weeks. I will work to stay productive and collaborate well with other learners, facilitators, and industry representatives by communicating openly and asking for feedback. If I start feeling overwhelmed, I will take breaks and use resources to help manage any stress.
</p>
</br>
<p> I’m hoping the Facilitation team can help me with career advice, suggest which new technologies to learn to improve my job chances, and guide me on the best path forward. Sometimes it’s hard to know which way to go when there’s so much to learn.
</p>
    </br>
    <p> I don’t have any other commitments that will affect my schedule, so I can fully focus on the bootcamp.
