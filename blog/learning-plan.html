                <strong class="p-relative">  Long-Term Career Goal</strong> <br/></br>
                My long-term career goal is to establish my own tech startup. To achieve this,I want to become a skilled programmer and find a job where I can use my coding skills. I hope to work on projects that help people and make a positive impact in the community. I really want to gain real-world experience that will help me build strong skills.
              </p>
            </br>

            <p>
              <strong class="p-relative">  Skills and Impact</strong> <br/></br>
              During this course, I’m hoping to use the skills I learn to develop software that solves problems. I want to create things that are useful and make people's lives easier. My destination is to land a job where I can grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful projects. I also want to build a good network, as this will help me get into a tech job and connect with others in the industry.

          <p>
            <strong class="p-relative"> Strengths and Limitations</strong> <br/></br>
            I believe my biggest strengths will be my ability to learn quickly and my willingness to try new things. However, I know I have some limitations too. I often doubt my abilities, which can lower my motivation. I also find it hard to ask for help when I need it, and this has been a challenge for me in Foundations. I worry that this might affect me during Bootcamp as well.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong class="p-relative"> Non-Technical Challenges</strong> <br/></br>
            I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be time management. I often don’t use schedules or to-do lists, so I lose track of my time. This makes me feel overwhelmed, and I spend less time on important tasks. Sometimes, I worry too much instead of focusing on what I need to do. I also tend to be a bit negative, and that affects my skills, especially in problem-solving and making connections with others.
          </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          <strong class="p-relative"> Developing Human Skills</strong> <br/></br>
          At Dev Academy, I want to work on my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. I think improving these areas will help me feel more confident when working with others. I also want to get better at giving and receiving feedback. This will help me grow and learn from my peers, making the experience more valuable.
      </br>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong class="p-relative">Expectations from the Bootcamp Team</strong> <br/></br>
        I expect the Bootcamp team to be supportive and guide me along the way. It’s really important for me to feel that I can reach out when I’m struggling, whether it’s with coding or just managing my workload. I hope for clear communication and encouragement from everyone. I also want to get some career support and advice that can help me find a job in the tech field. Additionally, I’d love help in building a network with industry professionals or graduates who are working in tech. They could guide me and educate me about potential opportunities, which would be really valuable.
      </p>
      </br>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong class="p-relative">Expectations of Myself</strong> <br/></br>
        I expect myself to stay focused and dedicated during Bootcamp. I plan to seek help from my peers and facilitators whenever I need it. I also need to start using schedules and to-do lists to manage my time better. This will help me prioritize my tasks and stay on track. Additionally, I want to stay positive, learn, and try new things. My goal is to build strong skills, land a job, and further develop my abilities. I also aim to improve my problem-solving skills and keep my motivation high throughout this journey.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong class="p-relative">Commitment to Managing Workload</strong> <br/></br>
        To manage my workload effectively, I will create a simple schedule that includes time for studying, practicing coding, and collaborating with others. I will try to stay positive and remind myself of my goals to keep my motivation up. I know I need to spend time on the things that matter and not let my doubts take over. Additionally, I will make an effort to stay motivated and keep a positive attitude, knowing that this will help me navigate challenges and make the most of my learning experience.
