                <strong class="p-relative">Three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning</strong> <br/></br>
                I’ve learned some important things about myself from the Human Skills learning. First, I need to improve my emotional intelligence (EQ) because it helps me understand and connect with people better. Second, practicing mindfulness for just five minutes a day really helps me focus and feel less stressed. Lastly, I found out that I often have a fixed mindset, which means I get stuck and don’t try new things. I want to shift to a growth mindset so I can embrace challenges and keep growing. These lessons have made me want to make some positive changes in my life.
              </p>
            </br>
            <p>
              <strong class="p-relative">Values</strong> <br/></br>
              Values are what I believe in, and they guide my actions. In programming, having good values is really important to me. For example, if I care about teamwork, I will work better with others. This makes the project more enjoyable and helps everyone share their ideas. Also, if I value honesty, I will create software that is fair and respects people’s privacy. So, my values help me decide how to act and how to treat others.
            </p>
          </br>
          
          <p>
            <strong class="p-relative">Empathy</strong> <br/></br>
            
            Empathy is about understanding how other people feel. In programming, this is super important because we make things for real users. If you can think about what users need, you can create better products. For example, if you’re building an app, you should think about what users find easy or hard to use. When you care about their feelings, you can make things that really help them. Empathy helps us connect with users and make things that matter.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong class="p-relative">Self-Awareness</strong> <br/></br>
            Self-awareness means knowing your own strengths and weaknesses. This is very important when learning and programming. If you know what you are good at, you can build on that. And if you know where you need to improve, you can work on those skills. For example, if you find a coding language difficult, you can spend more time practicing it. Being self-aware also helps you ask for help when you need it. Knowing yourself can help you grow as a learner and a programmer.

      <p>
        <strong class="p-relative">What has surprised me the most about the Human Skills learning?</strong> <br/></br>
        What has surprised me the most about the Human Skills learning is how important emotional intelligence (EQ) really is. I didn’t realize how much my EQ affects problem-solving. When I understand my own feelings and those of others, I can approach challenges with a clearer mind and generate better ideas.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>I also learned that having a growth mindset is crucial. It helps me see challenges as opportunities to learn rather than as obstacles. This mindset allows me to build more unique products and solutions because I’m not afraid to try new things or make mistakes. Overall, these skills are essential for becoming a better developer and creating meaningful work.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong class="p-relative">What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</strong> <br/></br>
       
              The most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning for me were definitely working on my emotional intelligence and communication skills. Sometimes, I found it hard to recognize my own feelings or understand how others were feeling. It felt uncomfortable to open up and share my thoughts, especially in group settings.

         Another tough part was trying to shift my mindset from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset. I often doubt my abilities and hesitate to take risks. Learning to embrace challenges and see mistakes as chances to grow is still a work in progress for me. Overall, these areas are tough but really important, and I believe they will help me improve over time.
      </p>
  </br>
  <p>
    <strong class="p-relative">Why do I think , a programming school, is spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</strong> <br/></br>
   
    I think focusing on Human Skills in a programming school is really important because programming isn’t just about writing code. It’s also about working with people. Good communication helps when you’re in a team, and understanding others’ feelings can make collaboration smoother.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>When we create software, we need to think about the users, not just the technical parts. Human Skills help us to be more empathetic, which means we can build better products that actually meet people’s needs. Plus, having a growth mindset makes it easier to handle challenges and learn from mistakes. Overall, these skills make us not just a better programmer, but a better teammate too.</p>
          <br>
          
          <p>
            <strong class="p-relative">Does the time I spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time?</strong> <br/></br>
           
            No, I don’t think the time spent on Human Skills was a waste at all. I never expected it would be so useful and have such a direct impact on my programming and problem-solving. Learning about emotional intelligence and mindfulness helps me manage stress and understand my feelings better. This, in turn, makes it easier to approach challenges with a clearer mind.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Improving our emotional awareness also helps us connect with others in a more meaningful way. Overall, the skills we’ve gained in this area are definitely valuable and will help us grow as developers in the long run.</p>
