                <strong class="p-relative">Three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning</strong> <br/></br>
                I’ve learned some important things about myself from the Human Skills learning. First, I need to improve my emotional intelligence (EQ) because it helps me understand and connect with people better. Second, practicing mindfulness for just five minutes a day really helps me focus and feel less stressed. Lastly, I found out that I often have a fixed mindset, which means I get stuck and don’t try new things. I want to shift to a growth mindset so I can embrace challenges and keep growing. These lessons have made me want to make some positive changes in my life.

              <strong class="p-relative">Values</strong> <br/></br>
              Values are what we believe in and guide what we do. In programming, having good values is really important. For example, if you care about teamwork, you will work better with others. This can make the project more fun and help everyone share ideas. Also, if you value honesty, you will make software that is fair and respects people's privacy. So, values help us decide how to act and how to treat others.

          <p>
            <strong class="p-relative">Empathy</strong> <br/></br>
            Empathy is about understanding how other people feel. In programming, this is super important because we make things for real users. If you can think about what users need, you can create better products. For example, if you’re building an app, you should think about what users find easy or hard to use. When you care about their feelings, you can make things that really help them. Empathy helps us connect with users and make things that matter.

            <strong class="p-relative">Self-Awareness</strong> <br/></br>
            Self-awareness means knowing your own strengths and weaknesses. This is very important when learning and programming. If you know what you are good at, you can build on that. And if you know where you need to improve, you can work on those skills. For example, if you find a coding language difficult, you can spend more time practicing it. Being self-aware also helps you ask for help when you need it. Knowing yourself can help you grow as a learner and a programmer.
